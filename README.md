### _**Description**_
We're fortunate to be surrounded by creativity. 

Everywhere we look (if we look closely enough) is a  hance to spot a window for innovation, and with such marvels readily within our respective fields of vision, wouldn't we be fools to look away?

Well, what if we _weren't_ looking away, but rather, were looking **directly** at it, but our ability to see it was obscured?

Introducing: **SMOKE** -- a social network specifically centered around showcasing creative endeavors.

SMOKE allows its CREATIVES to post their CREATIONS (ranging from Art, Film, Music & Theater to Chemistry, Theses, Mathematics, Physics, Intellectual Property and more) and allows its USERS (aka SPARKS) to engage directly with it by leaving a COMMENT or, choosing to like the post.

By using detail functionality, we can initially showcase each creative endeavor in a social feed with truncated / redacted information (such as its image, link and name) allowing for a cleaner U/I experience where the user retains information both at the headline & detail levels.

### _**Concept**_
To build **SMOKE** we'll be using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node,js).

The BACKEND of the site will be built with several components.  We'll use **NODE.js** to manage our server-side relations, while **Express.js** will provide our framework.  The DATA will be stored and managed in **MongoDB**.

The FRONTEND will be constructed primarily using **REACT**, utilitizing hooks such as useState, useEffect and more to transform an existing App.jsx file to import the PROPS of several different PAGES and COMPONENTS.

For **User Authorization** we'll be using React and Mongo's Built-In Authentication and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure privacy and user safety.
